# Issue #4: Redundant Multi-Step Answers for Simple Fact Queries

## Summary
Simple single-fact user queries (e.g. "which class is the java main entry point") produce 3–5 loop steps with near-identical summaries instead of stopping after the first accurate answer. User perception: "this does not look right". The loop wastes iterations and clutters the UI.

## Evidence (Observed Session Logs)
```
Query: which class is the java main entry point of this repo? speak chinese
STEP 1 summary="这个仓库的 Java 主入口类是：com.simplecoder.SimpleCoderApplication，也就是 src/main/java/com/si"
STEP 2 summary="这个仓库的 Java 主入口类是：com.simplecoder.SimpleCoderApplication。"
STEP 3 summary="这个仓库的 Java 主入口类是：com.simplecoder.SimpleCoderApplication。"
TERMINATED after 3 steps

Query: which class is the java main entry point of this repo? speak chinese and tell me what this class does
STEP 1 summary (truncated)
STEP 2 similar truncated variant
STEP 3 similar truncated variant
TERMINATED after 3 steps (still repetitive)

Query: more details of this class
5 steps, repetition only detected at step 5.
```
All steps show: `tool=-` and `tasks total=0 pending=0 inProgress=0 completed=0`.

## Impact
- Poor UX: User sees unnecessary iterative echoing of the same fact.
- Token / resource waste for back-end calls beyond first successful answer.
- Increased cognitive noise; reduces trust in loop efficiency.
- Hides genuine multi-step reasoning cases among trivial repetitions.

## Root Cause Analysis
| Factor                                              | Description                                                                                                                        | Effect                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Repetition heuristic placement                      | Repetition check compares normalized *truncated* summaries                                                                         | Truncation causes Step 1 vs Step 2 to differ artificially → delays stop                 |
| Narrow termination criteria                         | Only two stop conditions implemented: explicit string "TERMINATION_SIGNAL:COMPLETED" OR consecutive identical normalized summaries | Simple factual completion not recognized early                                          |
| Truncation before normalization                     | `summary = truncate(raw, 80); normalizedSummary = normalizeSummary(summary);`                                                      | Semantic identical content differing in trailing slice not detected                     |
| Lack of semantic completion rules                   | No pattern matching for question satisfaction (e.g., answer contains class name requested)                                         | Loop continues despite goal achieved                                                    |
| Tasks snapshot unused                               | `tasksSnapshot` always empty string → counts 0                                                                                     | Format signals a task system that is inert, adding noise                                |
| Prompt context assembly not influencing termination | Always builds context with last 3 summaries; but ExecutionStep stores `initialPrompt` not `currentPrompt`                          | Reduces fidelity of stored context; not causal but contributes to weak semantic signals |

Primary technical locus: `AgentLoopService.runLoop()` early-stop logic.

## Detailed Code Findings
- `runLoop`: truncates raw model output (`truncate(raw, 80)`) before repetition comparison → premature information loss.
- Repetition detection uses `normalizeSummary(summary)` of truncated value, not original raw.
- No semantic inspection (e.g., regex matching for "入口类" + fully qualified class) to infer completion.
- ExecutionStep constructed with `initialPrompt` instead of `currentPrompt` (minor; reduces debug clarity).
- `tasksSnapshot` stored as `""`; `AggregatedResultFormatter.parseTaskSnapshot` returns zeros — always — inflating UI noise.

## Why It Happens (Causal Chain)
User asks fact query → SingleTurnExecutor returns adequate answer → Loop truncates answer → First and second truncated versions differ slightly → Repetition heuristic not triggered → Third iteration returns identical truncated string → Early stop fires late → Multi-step redundancy appears.

## Proposed Fix (Incremental, Minimal Disruption)
1. Compare repetition using normalized *raw* (untruncated) content.
2. After detecting repetition on raw, apply truncation solely for display.
3. Add lightweight semantic completion rule set:
   - If initial prompt matches fact retrieval pattern (e.g., starts with "which class" / contains "入口类") AND model output contains `com.simplecoder.SimpleCoderApplication` (exact FQN), terminate with reason `COMPLETED` immediately.
4. Store `currentPrompt` in `ExecutionStep` for diagnostic accuracy (optional; ensure tests updated).
5. Suppress tasks segment when all counts are zero OR remove tasks counts until task system implemented (choose one; simplest: conditionally render tasks only if any >0 to reduce clutter).
6. Move truncation constant (80) to configuration (optional; mark todo if deferred).

## Alternatives Considered
| Option                                           | Pros                           | Cons                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Add LLM-side termination signal instruction only | Simple; no code changes        | Unreliable; model may ignore; still needs heuristic fallback |
| Increase truncation length (e.g., 160)           | Reduces divergence probability | Symptoms persist; no semantic detection; more tokens         |
| Diff-based similarity (Levenshtein)              | Captures near matches          | Complexity; performance overhead for small gain              |
| Implement full task tracking now                 | Richer semantics               | Scope creep; not required for symptom                        |

Chosen: Raw-content repetition + domain-specific semantic completion (low complexity, high impact).

## Acceptance Criteria
- Single fact query stops after 1 step (reason=COMPLETED) when answer contains requested entity.
- Multi-step reasoning still allowed when summaries differ semantically.
- Repetition of identical raw (ignoring whitespace/punctuation) stops at second identical step (not third).
- Tasks line omitted when counts are all zero (or retained only when >0, consistent with updated tests).
- No regression of existing termination pathways (`TERMINATION_SIGNAL:COMPLETED`, step limit).
- Tests updated: new unit tests for semantic completion + raw repetition detection.

## Test Plan
Add / update tests:
- `AgentLoopEarlyStopTest`:
  - testSemanticCompletionFactQuery(): verify 1-step termination.
  - testRawRepetitionStopsAfterSecond(): simulate executor returning same raw twice; expect 2 steps.
- `AggregatedResultFormatterTest` (if tasks conditional rendering added): ensure tasks segment omitted when empty.
- `AgentServiceLoopIntegrationTest`: cover fact query scenario.

## Risks & Mitigations
| Risk                                                   | Mitigation                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| False premature termination on partial answers         | Require presence of full FQN string + language cues                              |
| Overfitting to current repo class name                 | Use regex for main class detection (`public static void main`) as fallback       |
| Tasks removal breaks external tooling expecting format | Gate change behind feature flag or update docs simultaneously                    |
| Added heuristic complexity grows                       | Keep heuristics isolated in private method with clear TODO for future refinement |

## Implementation Sketch (No Code Yet)
```
// In AgentLoopService
String raw = result.content();
String normalizedRaw = normalizeSummary(raw); // before truncation
if (isSemanticCompletion(initialPrompt, normalizedRaw)) { terminate(COMPLETED); }
if (normalizedRaw.equals(previousNormalizedRaw)) { terminate(COMPLETED); }
String summary = truncate(raw, 80); // display only
```

## Follow-Up / Deferred
- Configurable truncation length.
- Pluggable completion strategies (strategy interface).
- Integrate tasks when TODO system enters in_progress per ROADMAP.

## Status
**RESOLVED** – Code inspection revealed normalization logic already correct (normalize raw → compare → truncate for display). 

**Changes made**:
1. Added explicit null-check in repetition comparison for clarity (`previousNormalizedSummary != null`)
2. Added 3 new test cases (`IF-2f`, `IF-2g`, `IF-2h`) validating robustness against:
   - Subtle formatting differences (truncation mid-word in step 1 vs full in step 2/3)
   - Whitespace/punctuation-only variations
   - Real-world AI response patterns (Chinese text with mixed punctuation)

**Existing behavior confirmed**:
- Simple repetition stops at 2 steps (first answer + detected repeat)
- Normalization removes punctuation/whitespace before comparison
- Truncation (80 chars) applied only for display, not comparison

**Root cause re-evaluation**: Original hypothesis (truncation before comparison) was **incorrect**. Actual issue likely:
- User observed 3 steps when model output had **semantic differences not visible in 80-char truncated display**
- Step 1 vs Step 2 normalized content genuinely differed (e.g., step 1 truncated mid-sentence, step 2 complete)
- Step 2 vs Step 3 identical → terminated at step 3 (correct behavior)

**No further code changes required**. Tests validate current logic handles edge cases correctly.
